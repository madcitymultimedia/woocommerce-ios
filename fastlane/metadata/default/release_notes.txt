This release includes a lot of exciting features! It's now possible to duplicate a product from the app. Just tap on the More Menu available inside the Product detail screen. We have also added a new stats widget so now you can view your current day's stats without opening the app. Lastly, due to popular demand, we're bringing back the ability to add/edit customer notes and addresses from the main order screen. 

We welcome your feedback on the app, especially the new features weâ€™re working on.
